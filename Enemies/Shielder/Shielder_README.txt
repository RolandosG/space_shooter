Enemy Class:

Represents a basic enemy in the game.
Contains properties such as health, death sound, and an event OnEnemyDestroyed to notify other classes of its destruction.
A method Defeat() is called when the enemy is defeated, playing the death sound and invoking the OnEnemyDestroyed event.
Shield Class:

Represents a shield that can be attached to another entity, presumably the Shielder.
The shield can take damage (TakeDamage method) and be destroyed (Explode method).
When destroyed, it plays a sound and notifies its parent Shielder, if any.
Shielder Class (Inherits from Enemy):

Represents a special type of enemy that uses a shield for protection.
It tries to locate the player and a set of snipers in the game.
Has the ability to target different snipers, changing its target every few seconds.
When it reaches its target location (i.e., near a sniper), it spawns a shield.
Contains a TakeDamage method which decreases its health.
Overrides the Defeat method from its base class to handle its specific defeat actions like explosion and rewarding the player with a score.
Has a method (ShieldDestroyed) to manage scenarios when its shield is destroyed.
